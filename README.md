# Firefly Algorithm – Python Implementation

This project implements the **Firefly Algorithm (FA)**, a nature-inspired optimization
metaheuristic proposed by **Xin-She Yang (2008)**.

The algorithm is inspired by the **bioluminescent flashing behavior of fireflies**,
where brighter fireflies attract others. This natural behavior is modeled to solve
complex optimization problems.

## 📌 Project Description

Each firefly represents a candidate solution.
- Brightness corresponds to solution quality (objective function value)
- Less bright fireflies move toward brighter ones
- Attraction decreases with distance
- Random movement allows exploration and avoids local optima

The algorithm is demonstrated using benchmark optimization functions such as the
**Sphere function**, and results are visualized to show convergence.
